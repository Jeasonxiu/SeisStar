# About Seis*

Seis* -- read Seis-Star -- is an ecosystem gathering the various bits and pieces needed to set up a seismic tomography based on adjoint methods.

The far-fetched explanation for the name comes from the [Kleene star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star). It aims to describe the possibilities of arranging various seismic tools to form workflows answering one's particular needs.
